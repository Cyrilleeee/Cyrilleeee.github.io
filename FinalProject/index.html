      <h2>Biography</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
        Hello there!
        <br><br>
        I'm Cyrille Candelaria, a high school senior at Union Square Academy for Health Sciences. I am a Filipina born in the Philippines and moved to NYC when I was eight years old. I'll be turning 18 this November.
         <br><br>
        I am a food enthusiast and love to bake. I also love to travel and explore new places. I am currently learning how to code and I am excited to see where this journey will take me.
      </p>
      <h2>Experience</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      I am in a CTE program at my school training to become a pharmacy technician. I also currently work at a pharmacy as a part-time job, which I started in my sophmore year. Combining school and work, I am able to learn more about medicine and pharmacy 
        <br><br>
        I am also a coding fellow at The Knowledge House, participating in a year long project-based fellowship. It’s my first tech/coding experience in which I learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Java Script. I developed this website and my Food Blog as my projects. I am excited to see where this journey will take me.
      </p>

      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <br>
      <p>
      Ever since I was a young kid, I’ve always wanted to become a doctor. In particular, I aspire to become a cardiologist. I find the heart to be the most interesting organ. However, I also want to combine my interest for technology at the same time. Tech and healthcare go hand-in-hand, and it is a field that will only grow from now. I hope to be a part of the journey. 
        <br><br>
        I will be graduating in June 2026 and will be attending college in the fall. I'm currently looking for colleges that offer bio-tech majors. I am also looking for internships in the healthcare field.
